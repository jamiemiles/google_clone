This project is a basic replication of the Google search engine's landing page.

What I learned:

This project taught me a lot about the power of css and the importance of correct ordering of elements within html.

As well as this, I have gained a solid understanding of css grid, however I am now extremely interested in learning flex, it seems as though flex may have the potential to offer more in terms of responsiveness and I am keen to dive deeper and learn more.

Critique:

Overall I am pleased with the finished result, however, the page is not acceptably responsive. When shrunk to the size of an iphone 5, the google search and feeling lucky buttons sit on top of one another and the footer anchors do not group together. This is something I will be looking to improvement upon throughout the course.
